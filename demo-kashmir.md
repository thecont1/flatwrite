  <summary>🛶 Shikara Night Stay — What to Expect</summary>
  <p>The shikara will be anchored in a quiet part of Dal Lake, away from the busier tourist zones. Your host will prepare fresh Kashmiri dinner on a small kerosene stove — expect <em>dum aloo</em>, <em>haak</em> (collard greens), and fragrant rice. Blankets and cushions are provided. You'll wake up around 5:30am to the sounds of the floating vegetable market — vendors paddling their boats filled with tomatoes, lotus stems, and leafy greens. It's a photographer's dream.</p>
